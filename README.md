# Weather App

1. This is a weather application, that shows the current weather data of cities (over 200,000+) using `openweather - API`
2. It asks for user's current location and displays weather data accordingly (If user gives permission)
3. User can search for a city using the searchbar
4. Additional data like sunrise & sunset, wind data, humidity, pressure etc. can also be found when user clicks on the additional details icon (bottom - right)

#### Important: Made for mobile screens, might not look appealing for larger screen sizes! <br>
